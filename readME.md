# Tic-Tac-Toe: A Simple Game to Test SamaritanDB

## About

In this section, we delve into a comprehensive demonstration of an application built upon the robust infrastructure of SamaritanDB. This demonstration showcases the essential components that drive the platform's functionality.

SamaritanDB represents a pioneering database solution engineered to offer internet users unprecedented control and sovereignty over their data within applications hosted on this innovative platform. In this context, we explore a practical application, the Tic-Tac-Toe game, as an example of how SamaritanDB empowers users to take charge of their digital interactions.

## Goal

![Generate Your DID](did-generation-image.png)

1. **Generate Your DID**: Start by creating your Decentralized Identifier (DID). This unique identifier is the key to your digital presence in the game.

![Submit to the Game](submit-to-game-image.png)

2. **Submit to the Game**: Send your DID and other necessary details to the game. Your information will be stored in SamaritanDB, ready for action.

3. **Leaderboard**: After you've submitted your data, you can play the game and keep an eye on your progress through the leaderboard.

![Deny Access](deny-access-image.png)

4. **Deny Access**: Suppose you decide to deny the application access to your data. By submitting a transaction, you block access to your information.

5. **Data Absence**: Check the leaderboard, and you'll see your data has disappeared. Access denial had an immediate impact.

6. **Grant Access**: Change your mind and decide to allow access again. Submit a transaction to grant access once more.

7. **Data Returns**: Visit the leaderboard, and your data is back in the game. It's all about user control and data ownership.

## Significance

This project demonstrates the potential of user control and ownership over the content and information provided to internet applications and services.

## How It Works

![Ink! Smart Contract](ink-contract-image.png)

The ink! smart contract powers this project. Users send requests to the contract, generating events and making blockchain state changes. SamaritanDB nodes worldwide respond to these events, adapting to user decisions.
